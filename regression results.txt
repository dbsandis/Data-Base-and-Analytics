The table you've provided shows the results of a regression analysis, detailing the effect of several predictors (acceleration, horsepower, displacement, cylinders, weight) on a dependent variable (not specified but could be something like fuel efficiency or performance metric). Here's a breakdown of each column in your results:

### Coefficient (coef)
- **Definition:** This value represents the estimated change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the predictor variable, holding all other predictors constant.
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Acceleration:** A one-unit increase in acceleration is associated with an increase of 0.1573 units in the dependent variable.
  - **Horsepower:** A one-unit increase in horsepower is associated with an increase of 0.0145 units in the dependent variable.
  - **Displacement:** A one-unit increase in displacement is associated with a decrease of 0.0060 units in the dependent variable.
  - **Cylinders:** A one-unit increase in the number of cylinders is associated with an increase of 0.2324 units in the dependent variable.
  - **Weight:** A one-unit increase in weight is associated with a decrease of 0.0003 units in the dependent variable.

### Standard Error (std err)
- **Definition:** This value measures the average distance that the observed values fall from the regression line. It provides an estimate of the precision of the coefficient estimate.
- **Interpretation:** Smaller standard errors indicate more precise estimates of the coefficient. For example, the standard error for the acceleration coefficient is 0.007, suggesting a relatively high level of precision in this estimate.

### t-Statistic (t)
- **Definition:** This is the ratio of the coefficient to its standard error. It's used to determine the statistical significance of the coefficient.
- **Interpretation:** Higher absolute values of the t-statistic indicate a higher level of confidence that the coefficient is different from zero. For acceleration, a t-statistic of 21.784 suggests a very strong evidence that the true coefficient is not zero.

### P-value (P>|t|)
- **Definition:** This value indicates the probability of observing the given result, or one more extreme, if the null hypothesis (that the coefficient is zero) were true.
- **Interpretation:** A p-value of 0.000 for all variables suggests that we can reject the null hypothesis for these coefficients at the common alpha levels (0.05, 0.01), indicating they are statistically significant predictors of the dependent variable.

### 95% Confidence Interval ([0.025 0.975])
- **Definition:** This range provides an interval within which we can be 95% confident the true coefficient lies. It's calculated based on the coefficient Â± (1.96 * standard error) for a 95% confidence level.
- **Interpretation:**
  - **Acceleration:** We are 95% confident that the true coefficient for acceleration lies between 0.143 and 0.171.
  - **Horsepower:** The true coefficient for horsepower likely falls between 0.012 and 0.017.
  - **Displacement, Cylinders, Weight:** Similarly, the intervals for these variables provide the range of values within which the true coefficients are likely to be found with 95% confidence.

These results together provide a detailed picture of how each predictor variable influences the dependent variable, along with the statistical significance and precision of these estimates.
